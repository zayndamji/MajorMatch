  "programType": "Major",
  "programName": "Earth Systems (B.S.)",
  "degreeAwarded": "Bachelor of Science",
  "fullProgramDescription": "The Earth Systems Program is an interdisciplinary major that examines the Earth as a complex, interconnected system. Students explore the Earth's physical, biological, and social processes and how they interact and influence one another. The program provides a broad foundation in Earth sciences, including coursework in geological sciences, ecology, biology, and environmental studies. Students also develop skills in data analysis, modeling, and problem-solving.",
  "shortProgramDescription": "The Earth Systems B.S. program provides students with a comprehensive understanding of the Earth's systems and the skills to analyze and address complex environmental challenges.",
  "classHighlights": [
    "üåé **Foundational Courses**: Students begin with introductory courses in Earth Systems (EARTHSYS 10, EARTHSYS 20) and take additional foundational courses in geological sciences, ecology, and environmental studies.",
    "üìä **Data Analysis and Modeling**: Students learn data analysis and modeling skills through courses such as Data Analysis for Earth Systems (EARTHSYS 108) and Earth Systems Modeling (EARTHSYS 205).",
    "üå≥ **Ecological and Biological Principles**: Coursework includes ecology, biology, and environmental studies, such as Ecology (BIO 43) and Conservation Biology (EARTHSYS 134).",
    "üåü **Earth's Physical Processes**: Students study the Earth's physical processes, including geology, climate science, and hydrology, through courses like Geology (EARTHSYS 53, EARTHSYS 55) and Climate Change (EARTHSYS 150).",
    "üë• **Social and Human Dimensions**: The program includes coursework on the social and human dimensions of environmental issues, such as Environmental Policy (EARTHSYS 131) and Sustainable Development (EARTHSYS 165).",
    "üîç **Research and Field Methods**: Students gain hands-on experience with research and field methods through courses like Field Methods in Earth Systems (EARTHSYS 105) and Research in Earth Systems (EARTHSYS 199)."

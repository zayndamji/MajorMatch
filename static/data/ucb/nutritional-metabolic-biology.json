  "collegeName": "University of California, Berkeley",
  "programType": "Major",
  "programName": "Nutritional & Metabolic Biology (B.S.)",
  "degreeAwarded": "Bachelor of Science",
  "fullProgramDescription": "The Nutritional and Metabolic Biology major provides a strong foundation in the life sciences, chemistry, and nutrition, preparing students for careers in research, healthcare, education, and industry. The program focuses on understanding the complex interactions between diet, metabolism, and health, and how nutritional factors influence disease prevention and treatment. Coursework includes molecular and cellular biology, biochemistry, physiology, nutrition, and metabolism.",
  "shortProgramDescription": "The Nutritional & Metabolic Biology major at UC Berkeley prepares students for careers in nutrition and health by exploring the complex interactions between diet, metabolism, and disease.",
  "classHighlights": [
    "The major begins with foundational courses in Molecular and Cellular Biology (IB 151, MCB C100A), General Chemistry (CHEM 1A/1B/1C, CHEM 3A/3B), and Introduction to Nutrition (NUTRIS 10), establishing a core understanding of biological and chemical principles as they relate to nutrition.",
    "Students then progress to upper-division courses that cover biochemistry (MCB C102, MCB 103), physiology (MCB C105, MCB 104), and metabolism (NUTRIS 202A, NUTRIS 202B), integrating knowledge of cellular processes, biochemical pathways, and nutritional metabolism.",
    "Advanced courses in Nutritional Biochemistry (NUTRIS 203), Nutritional Epidemiology (NUTRIS 204), and Molecular Nutrition (NUTRIS 206) provide in-depth exploration of the biochemical and epidemiological aspects of nutrition, as well as the molecular mechanisms underlying nutritional health.",
    "The curriculum also includes laboratory courses, such as Laboratory in Nutritional Biochemistry (MCB 104L) and Human Physiology Laboratory (MCB 105L), which provide hands-on experience in experimental techniques and data analysis relevant to nutritional and metabolic biology.",
    "Additional electives allow students to explore specialized areas, including nutritional genomics, obesity, and metabolic disorders, rounding out their understanding of the complex interactions between nutrition, metabolism, and health."

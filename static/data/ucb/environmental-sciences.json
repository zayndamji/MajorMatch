  "programType": "Major",
  "programName": "Environmental Sciences (B.A.)",
  "degreeAwarded": "Bachelor of Arts",
  "fullProgramDescription": "The Environmental Sciences major is a multidisciplinary program that combines the natural and social sciences to study the causes and consequences of environmental problems. The program is designed to provide students with a broad understanding of the complex interactions between human and natural systems, and to equip them with the skills and knowledge necessary to address environmental challenges. Students in the major choose a subplan in either Conservation and Resource Management or Environmental Policy and Culture.",
  "shortProgramDescription": "The Environmental Sciences B.A. provides a comprehensive understanding of environmental issues, combining natural and social sciences to prepare students for careers or graduate study in environmental fields.",
  "classHighlights": [
    "The Environmental Sciences major requires a foundational understanding of natural sciences, including Ecology and Evolution (IB 151 or IB 153), Environmental Biology (IB 160), and Introduction to Environmental Science (ES 12). These courses provide a basis for understanding the complex interactions between human and natural systems.",
    "Students also complete a series of social science and humanities courses, including Introduction to Environmental Politics and Policy (ES 112) and Environmental Sociology (SOC 165AC). These courses help students understand the social and cultural dimensions of environmental issues.",
    "In addition to these core courses, students choose a subplan and complete a series of subplan-specific courses. For example, students in the Conservation and Resource Management subplan take courses in ecology, conservation biology, and resource management, while students in the Environmental Policy and Culture subplan take courses in environmental policy, politics, and culture.",
    "The major also requires a series of upper-division courses, including Environmental Data Analysis (ES 123) and Environmental Capstone (ES 192). These courses provide students with hands-on experience analyzing environmental data and working on real-world environmental problems.",
    "Students in the major also have the opportunity to take a range of elective courses in fields such as ecology, conservation biology, environmental policy, and sustainability. These courses allow students to tailor their education to their interests and career goals."
